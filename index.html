    <h1>WORLD PROBLEMS!</h1>
    <p style = "color:aliceblue"> There are many problems in this world. A lot of these problems are dangerous and fatal. While creating this website, we hope to be give you some solutions to a couple of such problems&#128512;.<p>
    
      <p style = "color:aliceblue"> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment&#128567;.<p>
      <p style = "color:aliceblue"> Climate change describes a change in the average conditions — such as temperature and rainfall — in a region over a long period of time. NASA scientists have observed Earth's surface is warming, and many of the warmest years on record have happened in the past 20 years&#128561;.<p>
      <p style = "color:aliceblue"> Water scarcity is the lack of sufficient available water resources to meet the demands of water usage within a region. Water shortages may be caused by climate change, such as altered weather patterns including droughts or floods, increased pollution, increased human demand and overuse of water&#128565;.<p></p>
